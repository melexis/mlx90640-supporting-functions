1. Legal notice
 
Melexis has applied for a patent on this specific method of calculating the temperature by use of these lookup tables (patent application number: EP19177500.6).  
This method may only be used to calculate the temperature results from the raw data of a Melexis infrared sensor.  
With the purchase of a Melexis MLX90640/1 infrared sensor comes the right to use this software to calculate temperatures based on the output of that sensor.

2. The MLX90640 driver can be downloaded from the following address: https://github.com/melexis/mlx90640-library.git
